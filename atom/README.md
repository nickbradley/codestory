# Usage
Copy `init.coffee` and `keymap.cson` to your `.atom` directory.

# Notes
`init.coffee` defines the command `custom:codestory-paste` which enables the
CodeStory paste functionality. This will eventually be moved to a package.

`keymap.cson` binds `ctrl-shift-v` to the command `custom:codestory-paste`. You
can define any other binding you want, or just type the command name in Atom's
command pallette (ctrl-shift-p).
