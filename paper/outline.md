# CodeStory: Information Tracking for Program Comprehension
<!--Capturing External Context in Source Code-->
## Abstract
## Introduction
 - What is the problem? Reasoning about code.
 - Is this area worth pursuing (motivation)
   - mention pilot survey (no details, just that it supported further investigation)
 - Developers always copying from Stackoverflow => should keep that info
 - Our approach (summary of tool)
 - The contributions from the paper

 - Good for program comprehension, e.g.
   - Code review
   - maintenance
   - new programmer to code base

  - **Controlled experiment similar to ours**  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45051-1_14

## Approach
 - How do we solve the problem
   - Scenario: how does a dev copy/paste w/ tool
 - Why is our approach reasonable  

## Evaluation

### Pilot Survey
 - Number participants + background
 - Questions
 - feedback

### Study Description
 - Describe what the task was
 - Who participated + background

### Impact for Code Review Tasks
 - Result of code review (qualitative)
 - Result of survey (~quantitative)
 - Summary of results (merge the two)


### Threats to Validity


## Implementation
 - Discuss the implementation of the CodeStory tool
   - Google Chrome extension for capturing StackOverflow information for copy
   - Atom package for pasting link
   - Backend


## Discussion
 - Talk about some of the feedback from the survey
 - Drawbacks of the tool
    - change in workflow
    - extra comments could be annoying
 - privacy
 - data mining (the codestory DB)
 - Good for "micro" decisions; not so useful for "macro" decisions

## Future Work
 - Extend CodeStory to work with other programs (other than StackOverflow)
 - Support for more IDEs
 - Better Atom plugin - support showing the CodeStory in the IDE
 - Validate on other types of tasks (other than Code Review)

## Conclusion
