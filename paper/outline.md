# CodeStory: Capturing External Context in Source Code
Information Tracking for Program Comprehension
## Abstract
## Introduction
 - What is the problem? Reasoning about code.
 - Is this area worth pursuing (motivation)
   - mention pilot survey (no details, just that it supported further investigation)
 - Our approach (summary of tool)
 - The contributions from the paper

## Related Work
 - Design rationale: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4232835 (Sec II.A)
 - Capturing Design Knowledge: https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/02/mso2009020025.pdf

## Scenario?
This might be useful since we didn't evaluate the usage of the tool.

## Approach
 - How do we solve the problem
 - Why is our approach reasonable  

## Evaluation
### Pilot Study
 - Number participants + background
 - Questions
 - feedback
### Task Description
 - Describe what the task was
 - Who participated + background

### Impact for Code Review Tasks
 - Results on tasks (e.g. survey output)

### Threats to Validity

<!-- Combine this with the Approach section -->
## Enabling Information Tracking
 - Discuss the implementation of the CodeStory tool
   - Google Chrome extension for capturing StackOverflow information for copy
   - Atom package for pasting link
   - Backend


## Discussion
 - Talk about some of the feedback from the survey
 - Drawbacks of the tool
 - change in workflow
 - privacy
 - data mining (the codestory DB)
 - Good for "micro" decisions; not so useful for "macro" decisions

## Future Work
 - Extend CodeStory to work with other programs (other than StackOverflow)
 - Validate on other types of tasks (other than Code Review)

## Conclusion
