We are focused more on code comprehension instead of design


Capturing design rationale has been a goal for many years.

http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/18/1/iks-407-070.pdf - very similar

Takes a broad approach of capturing and orgainizing all design knowledge
 - system is separate from code
 - different process
 - trying to centralize and organize knowledge (we keep it near the code - hints in the code - keep it distributed)
 - tracibility


Several papers [is a DR vital] are focused on documenting the design rationale of software architecture and its evolution in a disciplined and structured manner. The problem with this approach is that it complicates the development process and adds to the initial cost of developing the software. Our approach differs from these because it is not a formal process and does not add much to the cost of development at any stage. Our tool is designed to capture just-enough, just-in-time without creating another process for a developer to work through. However, we do follow the methodology of [is a DR vital] but evaluate the captured rationale's ability to improve comprehension tasks instead of programming tasks.

- Focused explicitly on capturing the design rationale (i.e. make comments as you go -- forces you to think but my be nelecteg due to high-cost and inconvenience)
- We are more focused on implicit design rationale by capturing snippets of ... as knowledge is transferred between developers through text-based communication.


- Knowledge management in teams. [http://research.ijcaonline.org/irafit/number9/irafit1072.pdf] argues that one of the benefits of an agile approach is that knowledge is diseminated throughout a team through measures such as srcum meetings, pair programming and open cultural. This seems to be an appropriate approach to efficiently and effectively develop software products. Unfortunately, people have limited memory so if the information isn't captured it will be lost. Our tools takes advantage of these features
