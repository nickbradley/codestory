Software quality is strongly dependent on a developer's knowledge of the rationale that lead to code changes. Capturing this rationale would significantly improve program understanding tasks leading to higher software quality. Unfortunately, this is a hard problem because decisions are often made unconsciously and are not being tracked. This is partly due to the fact there is little tooling support and partly due to developers and managers putting little value in this information.

In this paper we describe a simple method for capturing developer's reasoning
during coding tasks. Our implementation, called CodeStory, integrates transparently
into a developer's workflow by hooking into the standard copy-paste operation. When developers copy text or code snippets from StackOverflow, CodeStory will capture additional context and include a reference to it with the pasted content in their code. This information can later be seen by other
developers giving them a better understanding of the author's rationale.
