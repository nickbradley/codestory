Program comprehension impacts code quality, velocity and efficiency. However, it
is a difficult task when only using code; many of the design and implementation
decisions are lost when transferring the information into code. Unfortunately,
capturing this information can be challenging, especially when it requires
significant changes in developer workflow. Further, if the information is captured
it must be linked to the section of code that it impacts and made available to
reviewers in a way that enhances comprenshion without being obtrusive.

In this paper we describe a simple method for caputring developer reasoning
during coding tasks. Our implementation, called CodeStory, integrates transparently
into a developer's workflow by hooking into the standard copy-paste operation. In
this iteration, when developers copy text or code snippets from StackOverflow,
CodeStory will scrape the page capturing additional context and including it with
the pasted content in their code. This information will later be seen by other
developers giving them a better understanding of the author's reasoning.
