The results of our study show that capturing and displaying contextual information makes comprehension tasks like code reviews eaiser. In order to make our study coherent and keep it to a reasonable length for our participants, we decided to forego evaluating our tool directly. However, there are several interesting questions that would help us improve our tool. For example,
  - should more info be shown in a comment?
  - does it fit into developer's workflows? Does it interfer with other tools?
  - Would they use the tool? Would they make our tool the default for pasting?
  - Recommendatios for improvements

We would also like to determine if the code story has different utility for different comprehension tasks. It wold be very interesting to know, for example, whether the bugs can be found and/or fixed more easily. Or, if new features are incorporated into the software in a more consistent manner or in less time because developers have a chain of rationale to follow.

The prototype can be extended to support more source like email clients and instant messaging applications. these are common tools used by development teams. also, extend the IDE package to support displaying the code story in the IDE so developers don't have to switch apps (which will no doubt break their workflow we've been so careful to avoid interrupting). On a similar note, you would need to develop the plugin for different IDEs (can't evaluate impact on workflow if the developer has to use an unfamiliar IDE).
