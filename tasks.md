 1. What information is available from SO?
 2. Survery with list of possible info items (what would be useful -- a rating) _and_ show different permuatations (presentation of aforemention result) and there should be a general question for how useful having extra information would be.
 3. Generate survey.
 4. Research how to build the tool
 5. What does the tool need to do specifically?
   - how to put stuff on the clipboard 
 
 Goals:
  - enrich clipboard with stuff from SO
  - Can we get the google search?
  - Find a way to paste the stuff in a formatted way (including creating a file and adding the clipboard content)
  - These need to be done without breaking standard copy/paste
  
 Target System:
   - Linux
