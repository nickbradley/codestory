## Deliverables
Week 1: Plan pilot study to determine what should be shown 
 a. What information can is available from SO?
 b. Survery with list of possible info items (what would be useful -- a rating) _and_ show different permuatations (presentation of aforemention result)
 c. Generate survey.
 d. Research how to build the tool
 e. What does the tool need to do specifically?
   - how to put stuff on the clipboard
 
By next Wednesday:
 - collect survey results.
 - estimate effort for implementing tool
 
 
 Goal:
  - enrich clipboard with stuff from SO
  - Can we get the google search?
  - Find a way to paste the stuff in a formatted way (including creating a file and adding the clipboard content)
  - These need to be done without breaking standard copy/paste
  
  Target System:
   - Linux
   - Ruby?
