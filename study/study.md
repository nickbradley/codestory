 4. Do you have any comments about CodeStory? Were you missing any information?
Developers donâ€™t tend to record their thoughts while writing code although this information could be valuable for program understanding. Our tool CodeStory interacts with StackOverflow and records copy paste information during development. Thank you for participating in this study!

# TODO
[] Design Study
[] Tooling


# Design Questions
 - What should the results look like?
   - Should they be quantitative (e.g. measure the time it takes to do a task)
   - Qualitative: collect feedback from participant about the experience. (Reid preferred this method)
     - When/how should the participant report? At the end, or after each run? Should it be comparative?


---
Factors:
 - is code snippet/diff annotated?
 - what is the code snippet/diff?
 - What do the participants do?

Concerns
 - Learning bias: should a participant see the same diff where one is annotated vs not annotated?
   - No. Since evaluative, not comparative, the user will hopefully say more positive things
     about their experience with the annotated diffs. However, we should be sure that each participant
     gets the same number of annotated and unannotated diffs.

  - Give a brief description of what the method containing the change does
  - What was the change?
  - What was the developer's intention when writing this code?




Please
write down all your thoughts and, in particular, what you believe this code does.


- What does the code do?
- Why does the patch exist?
- Do you think this was mainly an improvement, bug fix or new feature?
- If it was a bug, what did the patch fix?










# Study Methodology
We will conduct a qualitative qualitative of our tool by having participants

Randomized complete block design

## Parameters
Number of participants: >= 4

## Treatments
A treatment refers to the code snippet that will be shown to participants in the
diff.


# Example
Assume we have 6 diffs, D1-D6, and 4 participants, P1-P4.

| Diff | Annotated  | Unannotated |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
|   D1 | P1, P2     | P3, P4
|   D2 | P3, P4     | P1, P2
|   D3 | P1, P3, P4 | P2
|   D4 | P1, P2  P3 | P4
|   D5 | P2, P3, P4 | P1
|   D6 | P1, P2, P4 | P3
