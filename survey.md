Reading other peoples' code can be hard. Developers don't tend to record their thoughts while writing code. It would be nice to find a way to include this information and thus express the story behind the code. 

The intention behind this survey is to find out what information could be useful for understanding other peoples' code during code reviews and maintenance tasks. Oftentimes, a question-answer style communication will impact the implementation and it might be valuable to record this communcation.

For the following questions, imagine the following example: a developer has to choose a sort algorithm for a particular task. She googles "sort array in JavaScript" and finds a code snippet on StackOverflow. She copies the snippet as a scaffold into her code.

1.) Would having recorded that story be useful during code reviews and maintenance tasks?
2.) What elements would you consider useful? Please rate the following.
- Question URL
- Answer URL (link to segment of answer on StackOverflow)
- Search query
- Time of access

- Full answer the snippet was copied from
- Rating of the answer the snippet was copied from
- Whether the answer with the snipped was accepted
- Comments on the answer from which the snippet was copied
- Other answers on the question
