Reading other peoples' code can be hard. Developers don't tend to record their thoughts while writing code. It would be nice to find a way to include this information and thus express the story behind the code. 

The intention behind this survey is to find out what information could be useful for understanding other peoples' code during code reviews. Oftentimes, a question-answer style communication will impact the implementation and it might be valuable to record this communication.

For the following questions, imagine the following story: a developer has to choose a sort algorithm for a particular task. She googles "sort array in JavaScript" and finds a code snippet on StackOverflow. She copies the snippet as a scaffold into her code.

1.) Would it be useful to have the story above available during the code review?

2.) What elements would you consider useful? Please rate the following.
- Google search query
- StackOverflow question URL
- StackOverflow question heading
- StackOverflow question content
- StackOverflow answer URL
- Time of access of StackOverflow page
- StackOverflow answer code snippet
- Entire Stackoverflow answer
- Stackoverflow answer rating
- Stackoverflow answer acceptance status
- StackOverflow answer comments
- Other StackOverflow answers
